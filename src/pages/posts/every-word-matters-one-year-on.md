# every word matters: one year on

It's been a year to the day since I launched the publication [every word matters](http://medium.com/everywordmatters). I started not really knowing if it would be helpful or if I'd even get interviews.

Luckily, I can say the content design and UX writing industry is full of friendly, helpful and generous people. Everyone I asked was really supportive, whether they could take part or not. I was worried as I sent out email after email that asking the same questions to everyone would make for a repetitive, boring blog. What it's shown me is that everyone's experience is different. From the big questions, like getting into the industry, to the small questions, such as their top 3 apps, we can see such variety.

I've developed the questions as time has gone on. I've updated them to match the growing list of interviewees and the different companies they work with. This has shown new ideas and thoughts. It's also made me think about what I'd want to learn from our peers as I've developed within the industry. I hope this is the same for my readers as well.

As it hits one year I'm happy to see the publication has over 500 followers, far more than I thought I'd ever get. I'm also really proud that the first article ‚Äî [John Saito, Dropbox](https://medium.com/everywordmatters/john-saito-dropbox-ed55f0e08d1) ‚Äî has over 3,500 views!

Although it's slowed down, I'm still approaching people and publishing interviews as I get them. So keep an eye out over 2019.

What I've found is this has also become a great body of work that I can show people. I've talked about it with people at conferences and when interviewing for jobs. But, the main intention of this was to learn from my peers and make a resource for other people to learn from.

I've learnt a lot about my fellow Content Designers and UX Writers. We've discussed the variety of routes into the job, the different companies that have writers and the principles behind them. I hope my audience has found every word matters helpful and learnt from it as well.

I'd also like to say **thank you** to everyone that's taken part so far! üëè every word matters couldn't exist without the great interviewees we've featured so far.
