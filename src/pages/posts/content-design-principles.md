# My 7 content design principles

## 1. “I don’t know”

Always start with this.

## 2. Clarity

Use simple, common language. Don’t let technical accuracy get in the way of language that users can actually understand.

## 3. Simplicity

Make it efficient. Use the least amount of words you can. Edit, then edit again. But don’t compensate on clarity.

## 4. Consistent

Consistency is your users’ friend. It’s less work for them. Don’t expect users to make connections that aren’t clear.

## 5. Responsible

Avoid ‘dark patterns’ like confirm-shaming. Be better.

## 6. Experimentation

Approach all work as an experiment. You’re never right first time.

## 7. Poetic

Make it beautiful. It doesn’t need to rhyme! Even a simple, one word CTA can be beautiful.

These principles are fluid. I’ve developed and chosen them over a few years and I’m sure they’ll change in the future.

My original idea was ‘What should a content designer do?’ But this expanded into a broader exploration: what principles can guide a content designer to be effective and essentially “do the job well”.
