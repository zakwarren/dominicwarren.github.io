      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        Set up a blog interviewing Content Designers and UX Writers from across
        the industry that's helpful for anyone looking to join, or already in,
        the industry — <a
          href="https://medium.com/everywordmatters"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer">every word matters</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>Basic process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Decide on a name for the blog</li>
        <li>
          Look at other interview sites to see what questions they ask people in
          similar fields
        </li>
        <li>Compare hosting and blog platform options</li>
        <li>Set up a publication on Medium</li>
        <li>Set up a Twitter account for the blog</li>
        <li>Design a visual identity</li>
        <li>
          Start listing out people you want to interview, along with how to
          contact them
        </li>
        <li>Write out as many questions as I could think of</li>
        <li>Edit the questions down to a more manageable amount</li>
        <li>
          Start contacting people to see if they'd be interested in taking part
        </li>
        <li>
          If they are, send them the questions and request a photo of them
        </li>
        <li>
          Design the header images so the interviewees name, company and photo
          can be placed in
        </li>
        <li>Edit the response from interviewees</li>
        <li>
          Draft the response on Medium, writing tags and adding it to the
          publication
        </li>
        <li>Review the interview one last time</li>
        <li>Publish the interview</li>
