      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Project</h3>
      <p>
        Preparing all the Council Tax pages owned by the VOA to be connected
        onto a topic page, so they're listed alongside all other Council
        Tax-related pages.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        Review all VOA-owned Council Tax pages, updating any that need updating,
        removing any that are no longer relevant. Also, merging content if
        needed and tagging all with the appropriate metadata to be pulled into
        the topic page.
      </p>

      <h3>My role</h3>
      <p>Writer, editor, liason</p>

      <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Government Digital Services (GDS) project lead</li>
        <li>GDS content designer</li>
        <li>Council Tax online product owner</li>
        <li>Council Tax subject matter expert</li>
        <li>Communications department</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>
        Make sure all content is relevant, up-to-date and the pages have
        appropriate tagging.
      </p>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Collaborating with a number of stakeholders from multiple internal teams
        and different departments.
      </p>

      <h3>Basic process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Collected a list of all Council Tax pages owned by the VOA</li>
        <li>Organised these into their page types</li>
        <li>
          Mapped the pages as post-it notes on the wall as a visual
          representation to show internal stakeholders
        </li>
        <li>
          Meeting with GDS stakeholders to make sure our timelines were both
          moving together
        </li>
        <li>Reviewed each page individually</li>
        <li>Sent any feedback or changes to the appropriate product owner</li>
        <li>Made updates based on any feedback from the product owner</li>
        <li>Removed or merged pages after receiving sign off</li>
        <li>
          Added metatags to pages that were finalised and had been signed off
        </li>
        <li>Kept GDS updated with each batch of pages</li>
        <li>
          Re-reviewed all the pages to make sure they had the correct tags,
          ready for the switch-over day
        </li>
        <li>Got final sign off from the Council Tax stakeholders</li>
        <li>Got final sign off from Communications</li>
        <li>
          Made sure all the pages were on the topic and in the correct order,
          under the correct subtitles
        </li>
        <li>
          Updated the link on the VOA homepage to direct users to the new topic
          page
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>
        A much easier repository of information for users that are looking for
        Council Tax information. Also, a more consistent approach to the Council
        Tax topic, matching the wider GOV.UK style.
