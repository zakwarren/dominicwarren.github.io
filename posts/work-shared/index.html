    <h1 id="having-your-work-shared">Having your work shared</h1><p>I initially started my blog articles as an element of my portfolio. UX writing work is really hard to showcase, it certainly is different to visual design. But the articles are a way for me to show my thinking and what I’ve learnt.</p><p>However, it’s really nice and encouraging when you see people sharing them. Especially when those people are well-known across the industry or are people you admire.</p><p>One person who has shared my article, <a href="/posts/what-is-ux-writing">What is UX writing?</a>, is <a href="https://twitter.com/jmspool">Jared Spool</a>.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As <a href="https://twitter.com/dominicwarren1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dominicwarren1</a> explains, you can begin a project by writing a conversation between your design and your user. This exercise helps you determine what content you need in the design.<br><br>We’ll share this great resource with <a href="https://twitter.com/CenterCentre?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CenterCentre</a> students.<a href="https://t.co/eYzee4CjzW">https://t.co/eYzee4CjzW</a></p>— Jared Spool (@jmspool) <a href="https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/1159090570381418497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2019</a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>When I saw it, it’s safe to say, I was shocked. To have your work recognised and shared by someone with the influence and reach Spool does is really exciting. It’s also a great sense of validation — that proponents in the industry agree with what I think and write.</p><p>It’s also great that he’s shared it a number of times, quoting different parts of the article.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“One big area of difference between a UX writer and most other writing is how closely we work with designers.<br><br>It doesn’t make any sense to build a service or product and then drop words into it at the very end.”<br><br>— <a href="https://twitter.com/DominicWarren1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dominicwarren1</a><a href="https://t.co/eYzee4CjzW">https://t.co/eYzee4CjzW</a></p>— Jared Spool (@jmspool) <a href="https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/1175999231309623301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2019</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In this article, <a href="https://twitter.com/DominicWarren1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dominicwarren1</a> explains how UX writers and designers benefit from working together from the beginning of a project.<br><br>It doesn’t make sense to build a product, then try to drop content in at the end.<a href="https://t.co/eYzee4CjzW">https://t.co/eYzee4CjzW</a></p>— Jared Spool (@jmspool) <a href="https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/1165755231830982657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2019</a></blockquote><p>I was also really surprised when I received an issue of Ten Things, by <a href="https://twitter.com/La_Pope">Lauren Pope</a>.
Under Thing 3 I found my own article, <a href="http://dominicwarren.com/posts/accepting-feedback">Don’t be precious: accepting edits and feedback</a>, listed.</p><p><a href="https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=745f6a81d2d1e196c7d473704&amp;id=4dc0429eb9">Lauren Pope’s Ten Things</a></p><p>Lauren is someone I’ve admired since I started in the industry. So to see my article listed on her newsletter is a great feeling.</p><p>Again, having your work recognised like this is wonderful. It’s one of the reasons I’m keen to share articles I like on my
<a href="https://twitter.com/dominicwarren1">Twitter</a>. I might not have as many followers as some, but it’s a way for me to say I really enjoyed the article.</p><p>I’d really recommend <a href="https://mailchi.mp/b140ade59ab5/ten-things">signing up to Ten Things</a>. It’s always full of interesting articles.</p><p>PS you can read an <a href="https://medium.com/everywordmatters/lauren-pope-freelance-c3d1df376649">interview with Lauren at every word matters</a>.</p><hr><p>12 November 2019</p>
