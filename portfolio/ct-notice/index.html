      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Project</h3>
      <p>New content for Council Tax notice of alteration.</p>

      <p>Writer</p>

      <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        Council Tax online product owner, Council Tax subject matter expert.

      </p>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Making sure the content answers the users' questions, steering them away

      <h3>Basic process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Get understanding of key points from SME</li>
        <li>Write first draft</li>
        <li>Get draft checked for factual accuracy by SME</li>
        <li>Have work checked by other Content Designers</li>
        <li>Publish</li>
        <li>
          After 3 months checked by other Content Designers from other
          departments and GDS
        </li>
        <li>Update</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>
        There was a drop in the number of customers contacting the VOA about
        Council Tax notices of alteration.
      </p>

      <h2>Detail</h2>
      <p>
        While working on a new digital service I received statistics on the
        number of contact we're getting from the public and what they're asking
        about. I categorised the types of contact (such as Council Tax, business
        rates, etc) and then grouped these into topics (such as 'paying my
        bill', 'changes to my property', etc). I tallied up the amount of
        contact we're getting for each group and ordered them into the top 10
        for each business category.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Council Tax, one of the top 10 was people not knowing what a 'notice
        of alteration' is, means or what to do with it. I then looked over our
        record of pages on GOV.UK and did my own searches for information -
        there was nothing. This showed a major gap in the information we're
        providing and there's clearly a user need for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, I contacted the product owner for Council Tax online. I explained
        the contact results and how information was missing from GOV.UK. The
        product owner then provided a subject matter expert (SME) and I asked
        them to provide me a bullet list of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>what a notice of alteration is</li>
        <li>why someone would receive one</li>
        <li>what they'd need to do if they received one</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With this basic outline of the information I could write the content in
        a clear and simple way. I sent my first draft to the SME and product
        owner so they could check it for factual accuracy. The final sentences
        of the content explain to the reader they can “appeal the decision” and
        links to a page called “Council Tax appeals”. They argued this isn't the
        correct terminology and it's actually a 'Council Tax challenge'.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's generally agreed that Google is the 'homepage' of GOV.UK. Users
        search Google and access GOV.UK through the results they get. Using
        Google Trends to provide statistical evidence, I compared 'Council Tax
        challenge' and 'Council Tax appeal' in the UK over the last 12 months.
      </p>
      <img src="/portfolio/ct-notice-alteration/google-trends-ct-challenge-appeal.jpg" alt="Google trends council tax challenge appeal">
      <p>
        This showed that 'appeal' is used far more than 'challenge'. I provided
        this information to the product owner and the SME to back up my word
        choice. After seeing this they agreed with my decision and were happy
        for me to go ahead with the content I'd written.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before publishing to GOV.UK I then took this page to a 'content crit'
        with the other Content Designers in the VOA. We then read through it and
        they gave me feedback and suggestions. Having this fresh pair of eyes
        was really helpful and helped inform a better way of structuring the
        content. I then published the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 3 months I took my content to a content crit with Government
        Digital Services (GDS). This crit had a number of people from different
        government departments and a GDS representative. Holding the content
        crit with a larger audience, with different views and experiences,
        helped inform the way it's written even further. I managed to cut the
        number of words down into more concise sentences that directly told the
        audience the information they needed to know.
      </p>
      <p>
        After this I contacted the product owner and SME to get one last check
        that it was still factually accurate. They were happy with the content
        and I updated it on GOV.UK, publishing to live.
