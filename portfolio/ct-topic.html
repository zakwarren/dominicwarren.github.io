<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Project</h3>
<p>Preparing all the Council Tax pages owned by the VOA to be connected onto a topic page, so they’re listed alongside all other Council Tax-related pages.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>Review all VOA-owned Council Tax pages, updating any that need updating, removing any that are no longer relevant. Also, merging content if needed and tagging all with the appropriate metadata to be pulled into the topic page.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<li>Kept GDS updated with each batch of pages</li>
<li>Re-reviewed all the pages to make sure they had the correct tags, ready for the switch-over day</li>
<li>Got final sign off from the Council Tax stakeholders</li>
<li>Got final sign off from Communications</li>
<li>Made sure all the pages were on the topic and in the correct order, under the correct subtitles</li>
